# Changelog

## v1.2.0

### Direct Install
- PKG files can now be installed from another device, such as a PC, directly to the console without a temporary disk copy

### Networking
- Moved package streaming and Direct Install services to ports `18841` and `18842` to avoid potential conflicts with other homebrew applications. The web interface remains on port `8844`.

### SMB Streaming
- Improved SMB package streaming performance, reaching approximately 110 MB/s during installs in ideal conditions
- Added streaming diagnostics to help identify network and server bottlenecks

### Extended USB Storage
- Available-space checks now include extended USB storage (`/mnt/ext0`)

### Package Badges
- PS4 and PS5 package badges are now shown in package lists

### Package Detection and Scanning
- Fixed detection of PS5 DLC packages
- Fixed drive scans hiding other packages when an unknown package was present, such as during a copy operation

### Multi-Language PKG Titles
- Package titles now display in your browser's preferred language instead of the first available entry
